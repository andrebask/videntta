# videntta
A simple yet powerful program that can be used to extract emails from Large files
If intergrated or expanded can be helpful to data reserchers to gather emails from Large
document(s).

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Python](https://python.org/) to run. Download [Videntta](https://github.com/stevemats/videntta/) program from github and store it in
your desired folder location .e.g. Desktop. Next create a folder with a deisred name 
and extract the zip inside it. From there store the text document that you need to extract
emails from in folder named "data" and rename your document from the initial name to 
"info". As simple as that.

Now lets run our program in our desired terminal. For demonstration I'll be using 
Command Prompt(cmd), Linux users can as well follow up:

--Windows users
```sh
C:\Desktop> cd videntta    (Videntta is the folder we extracted the program into)
C:\Desktop> dir            (To view the directory)
C:\Desktop> python vein.py  (Now running our program to extract the emails)
```

--Linux Users

```sh
$ cd downloads\videntta       (Assuming the downloaded program is in downloads)
$ ls                          (To view the files inside our folder)
$ python vein.py
```
